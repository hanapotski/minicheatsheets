Have you ever found yourself searching the same commands on Google?  
Why not make a go to page every time you need to be reminded of a something? :)

## Intro
I was inspired to do this after someone showed me that this is possible. I wanted to make something similar to that and share it with beginners like me :heart:

## Usage

![addcheatsheet.gif](logos/addcheatsheet.gif)

1. Fork this repo and then clone it.  
2. Go to https://keep.google.com  
3. In a new Google Keep note, copy and paste the text of one of the .txt files you've just downloaded.
3. If you want to add a picture at the top of the note, just drag the picture into the note. (I've included the pictures I used in the logos folder or you can use your own picture)
